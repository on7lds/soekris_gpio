1.0   2003-07-31   
* Initial release

1.1   2003-08-14   
* Added IOCTL support, code-cleanup

1.1.1 2003-08-15   
* Fixed major problem (kernel oops) in the initialization of the module

1.1.2 2003-08-15   
* Minor cleanup regarding speed when writing to the GPIOs

1.1.3 2003-08-18   
* Fixed problem with setting the direction of the GPIOs 
  (which was introduced with the previous speed improvement...)

1.1.4 2003-10-07   
* Fixed problem IOCTL calls causing segfault

1.2.0 2003-11-09
* Added support for net4801
* Rewrite to implement 4501 and 4801 driver with a common interface

1.2.1 2003-11-27   
* Bugfixes to reading error_led and gpio ports, thanks to Dave Johnson

1.3.0 2004-01-22
* Added support for the voltage and temperature monitors on the 4801
* Cleaned up proc handling
* Added drivertest program, to make sure all functions still work after a 
  code change
* Reorganized the code so there's only one (somewhat bigger) module 
  for 4801 and 45xx   
  
1.3.1 2004-01-26
* Since the previous release was not quite finished (but released to respond 
  to an inquiry on the soekris-tech list) this release takes care of all open 
  issues (documentation, test-program)
* Fixed bug with writing to /dev/gpio1 (4801 only)

1.3.2 2004-02-24
* fixed "unresolved symbol __number_of_pins", that occurred if the module was 
  stripped with "--strip-unneeded"
* fixed (?) problem with MODVERSIONS enabled in the kernel
* corrected JP5 description in 4801gpio.h

1.3.3 2010-11-20 by Lieven De Samblanx
* Added 5501 driver
* Removed __exit annotations to prevent section mismatch(es) errors
    (thanks to Geert Uytterhoeven)
* Terminated string after read from userspace. Unterminated string could
  prevent setting the 12th GPIO pin via /proc/soekris_io_settings
* Added helper and test scripts
