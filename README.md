# Soekris gpio kernel module
also check https://on7lds.net/ldsped-soekris/GPIO/index.html

Provides basic control (read and write) over the 8/12 general purpose IO-pins of the Soekris Net45xx/Net4801 and the error-led (which happens to be connected to another general purpose IO pin)
On the Net4801 the driver also allows access to the termperature sensors and voltage monitors.

Take note: I wrote this code in 2010 and did not test/use it any more since 2012.
